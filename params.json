{"name":"pyvmomi-community-samples","tagline":"A place for community contributed samples for the pyVmomi library.","body":"### Welcome to the pyvmomi-community-samples project\r\n\r\nThis is a place for anyone to learn about working with the vSphere Management SDK's native python binding library pyVmomi. Samples here are contributed by developers like you and curated by your fellow developers.  The quality and validity of the samples will vary, however, if you see a problem report it! If you can solve someone's problem, contribute a fix! If you need a new sample ask for one!\r\n\r\n### Getting Started\r\n\r\n1. get [Python](https://www.python.org/download/)\r\n1. get [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html)\r\n1. get pyvmomi using pip\r\n\r\n'''\r\n $ pip install pyvmomi\r\n'''\r\n\r\nNow you are ready to get and use the samples project:\r\n\r\n'''\r\n $ git clone https://github.com/vmware/pyvmomi-community-samples.git\r\n'''\r\n\r\n### Reporting a problem or requesting a missing sample\r\n\r\nSimply file a issue on at [pyvmomi-community-samples/issues](https://github.com/vmware/pyvmomi-community-samples/issues) please start requests for new samples with the words: \"New Sample:\" to help our triage folks identify the sample request.\r\n\r\n### Contributing a sample\r\n\r\nFirst read up on [github forks](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) so you know the basic terms for how to work with github. We are asking that you branch each new sample independently for sanity's sake. This lets you submit multiple samples at one time and lets us evaluate multiple samples independently.\r\n\r\n1. fork the repository\r\n1. clone your fork locally\r\n1. make a branch for your sample and check it out\r\n1. commit the branch to your repo\r\n1. make a pull request\r\n\r\nSome notes on branching, editing code, then pushing the code back up to github...\r\n\r\n'''\r\n $ git clone  git clone https://github.com/your_user_name/pyvmomi-community-samples.git\r\n $ cd pyvmomi-community-samples\r\n $ git branch your_sample_name\r\n $ git checkout your_sample_name\r\n $ vim samples/your_sample_name.py\r\n $ git add samples/your_sample_name.py\r\n $ git commit\r\n $ git push origin your_sample_name\r\n'''\r\n\r\nNow you're ready to create a pull request to the official project.\r\n\r\n### Synchronizing your fork with the main project\r\n\r\nReplace the words 'your_user_name' below with your own user name and you should end up with the ability to issue yourself a pull request containing the current state of the main project's code!\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/your_user_name/pyvmomi-community-samples/compare/your_user_name:master...vmware:master","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
