				<h3>Tutorial</h3>
				<p>
					VMware hosts an online training series â€” VMware Hands On Labs. They are
					available for free <strong>[Registration required]</strong> at:<br> <a
						href="http://labs.hol.vmware.com/">labs.hol.vmware.com</a>
				</p>
				<p>With Hands-on Labs, you can get a lab up and running in minutes with
					full technical capabilities, without downloading or installing anything new
					on your existing hardware.</p>
				<p>
					The lab <em><a href="http://labs.hol.vmware.com/HOL/catalogs/lab/1499">HOL-SDC-1422
							- VMware Development Tools and SDKs</a></em> contains a module devoted to using
					pyvmomi.
				</p>
				<p>In this tutorial you will:
				<ul>
					<li>Run a simple pyvmomi sample that lists the VMs in a datacenter.</li>
					<li>Learn about developing scripts with pyvmomi using Eclipse, pyDev,
						and Workbench IS (VMware Eclipse-based developer tools).</li>
					<li>Learn how to use the debugger to step through code and inspect
						return values.</li>
					<li>Use the interactive Python interpreter to walk through the vCenter
						inventory hierarchy, find a VM, and power it on.</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<p>When you enroll and start the lab, a virtual datacenter will be
					provisioned for you complete with vCenter, two ESXi hosts, storage, and a
					few VMs. A remote console provides a desktop with tools, pyvmomi, and a few
					samples already installed. Alongside is a step by step guide that walks you
					through the tutorial. Just skip ahead or use the table of contents (under
					more options) to skip to module 2.</p>
				<p>The lab is yours for four hours at a time and you can enroll as many
					times as you want.</p>
				<h3>More Information</h3>
				<p>
					If you wish to use the same tools as in the <em>Development Tools</em>
					hands on lab, you will want Eclipse (<a href="http://www.eclipse.org">www.eclipse.org</a>),
					PyDev (<a href="http://pydev.org">pydev.org</a>), and Workbench IS. You can
					find more information, and downloads for Workbench IS in the Resources
					section at <a href="https://developercenter.vmware.com">developercenter.vmware.com</a>
